EGLOT-TEMPEL

Simple shim adapter to use the tempel templating library with eglot, instead of yasnippet.

This will take the LSP template provided by the server and convert it into a format tempel can take advantage of.

Understandably, this package conflicts with yasnippet and due to the dynamic nature of elisp, needs to load after eglot.
